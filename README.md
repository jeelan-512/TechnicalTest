# News App : Android MVVM Architecture (Kotlin + ViewModel + JetpackCompose + Coroutines + Kotlin Flow + Ktor)

MVVM Architecture :
Model — View — ViewModel (MVVM) is the  software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns. MVVM suggests separating the data presentation logic(Views or UI) from the core business logic part of the application.

Coroutines + Kotlin Flow :
In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value. For example, you can use a flow to receive live updates from a database.

JetpackCompose:
JetpackCompose is a toolkit for building native UI and it makes Android UI faster and easier.  

Ktor:
Ktor is a client-server framework that helps us build applications in Kotlin. It is a modern asynchronous framework backed by Kotlin coroutines. Ktor can be compared to network library such as OkHttp and Retrofit. We can use Ktor to make HTTP network requests to an API to get the response back to an application.
